* **Persist** `StateMachine` - means transform it into serializable representation, such as `Serializable` object or
  JSON text, and possibly saving it into some persistent storage like a file or sending by a network.
* **Restoration** - is a process of restoring the `StateMachine` from the serializable representation.

There are several kinds or levels of `StateMachine` persistence (serialization). Let's look at sample use cases:

1) **Structure + configuration** - Create `StateMachine` on some process/host and send its structure and
   active configuration by network to another process/host.
   The receiver can dynamically create the same `StateMachine` instance in the same state as original one.
2) **Configuration only** - Both original and restored `StateMachine` instances are crated by identical static code
   (in a single or multiple different processes/hosts). Only active configuration can be saved and restored.

Case 1 currently lacks built-in support by the library (you can open an issue if you need something like that).
Case 2 in turn may be reached in two different ways:

1) **Persisting state** - serializing all internal data, active states, variables etc. from original `StateMachine` and
   applying them to restored one.
2) **Event recording** - serializing all incoming events, and applying them later on new `StateMachine` instance,
   which should lead it into the same state as original. This also allows to execute library callbacks (listeners)
   if necessary, which is not possible with state persistence approach.
   _Currently only this approach has built-in support._

## Event recording

The library supports event recording out of the box. To enable it you should use `EventRecordingArguments` in
`CreationArguments` when creating a machine instance by `createStateMachine()` functions family. The recording process
can be configured with `EventRecordingArguments` properties.

```kotlin
val machine = createStateMachine(
    creationArguments = buildCreationArguments { eventRecordingArguments = buildEventRecordingArguments {} }
) {
    // ...
}
```

When the machine had processed your business logic events, and you want to save its state configuration, first you have
to get the recorded events:

```kotlin
val recordedEvents = machine.eventRecorder.getRecordedEvents()
```

`RecordedEvents` object now is ready to be serialized. The library provides an implementation
of serialization process using `kotlinx.serialization` library starting from `KStateMachine` version `v0.32.0`.

Initialize serialization format (JSON for instance) using `KStateMachineSerializersModule`. This module contains
serialization routines for library classes.

```kotlin
    val jsonFormat = Json {
    // use special, library provided SerializersModule for RecordedEvents and its internals
    // from kstatemachine-serialization artifact
    serializersModule = KStateMachineSerializersModule + SerializersModule { /* ... */ }
}
```

And encode (serialize) `RecordedEvents` object:

```kotlin
val recordedEventsJson = jsonFormat.encodeToString(recordedEvents)
```

### Custom serialization library

Alternatively you can use some other serialization library to serialize `RecordedEvents` class by your own
(you will also need to serialize `SerializableGeneratedEvent` class for internal events generated by the library
itself).

## Restoring StateMachine

When a user wants to restore the StateMachine, he deserializes `RecordedEvents` object and
creates StateMachine instance having exactly the same structure as original one.
Typically, both instances are created by the same code.

```kotlin
val restoredRecordedEvents = jsonFormat.decodeFromString<RecordedEvents>(recordedEventsJson)
```

Calling `restoreByRecordedEvents()` or its blocking analog `restoreByRecordedEventsBlocking()` will process
recorded events over just created StateMachine instance.

```kotlin
machine2.restoreByRecordedEvents(restoredRecordedEvents)
```

`restoreByRecordedEvents()` method will start the machine if necessary.
You can configure restoration process by `restoreByRecordedEvents()` arguments.
The machine should not process any events before its restoration (in such case exception will be thrown) as
it can possibly lead to incorrect restoration result.

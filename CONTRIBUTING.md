# Contribution guide

You are welcome to become a contributor for this project.

Steps you should go through:
1) Open an issue or a discussion on github
2) Explain your case or problem that you want to solve, and offer your solution if you have it.
   Clearly indicate that you are ready to submit a pull request (PR).
3) Disscuss the solution with the maintainer, util it is clear for both how it should work.
   You will get explicit confirmation that you can start working on the solution.
   This is neccessary to minimise the risk to make changes that would be rejected
4) Implement the solution, following project codestyle
5) Cover new functionality with tests
6) Add code sample and update docs with new functionality
7) Submit a PR on github
8) Pass code review process
9) Your PR will be merged by the maintainer
10) The changes will be available in next release version

That is all, thank you for your contribution.
